## Domains

Domains live in `./lib/domains.txt` as alist of TLDs and SLD+TLDs.

Right now, the only valid government top level domains (TLDs), represent the US government and are `.gov`, and `.mil`.

Secondary domains (e.g., `gov.uk`, or `mil.au`) detect non-US government entities.

To add or remove a domain from the list of known government domains, simply edit the `domains.txt` file.
